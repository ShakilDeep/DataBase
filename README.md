Title: High-Performance Database System for Handling 400-600 Million Users' Transactions per Second

Abstract:
This dissertation explores the design and implementation of a high-performance database system capable of efficiently handling a massive number of transactions, ranging from 400 to 600 million users' transactions per second. The objective is to develop a database architecture that ensures robustness, scalability, and optimal performance to meet the demanding needs of modern large-scale applications.

The proposed database system leverages a distributed architecture based on a sharding technique, where data is partitioned across multiple nodes for parallel processing. Each shard consists of a cluster of high-capacity servers that employ efficient data indexing and caching mechanisms to minimize latency. Additionally, the system employs advanced load balancing techniques to evenly distribute the transactional workload across shards.

To ensure fault tolerance and data integrity, a replication strategy utilizing synchronous replication is implemented. This guarantees that all transactions are consistently applied across multiple replicas, minimizing the risk of data loss or inconsistencies.

The database system incorporates advanced query optimization techniques and employs modern data compression algorithms to reduce storage requirements and enhance overall performance. Furthermore, it utilizes in-memory computing and distributed caching to expedite data retrieval and minimize disk I/O.

Through rigorous testing and performance benchmarking, this research establishes the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed database system for handling the enormous transactional demands of 400-600 million users per second.
